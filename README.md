The merged project, **Zi Airdrop Playground**, is a decentralized application (dApp) built with **Next.js 14**, combining features for secure airdrop management with a referral system inspired by modern platforms like Slack, Notion, and Figma. It leverages blockchain technology, WebAuthn for authentication, and a magic link referral system. The project is developer-friendly, responsive, and optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

#### Key Features
1. **Airdrop Management**: Distribute digital assets to multiple recipients via blockchain smart contracts.
2. **Referral System**: Magic link-based referrals powered by **NextAuth.js** and **Firebase (Now Soroban Contact)**, inspired by collaborative platforms.
3. **WebAuthn Authentication**: Passkey-based secure user authentication.
4. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile using **Tailwind CSS** and **Tremor** components.
5. **Blockchain Integration**: Stellar Soroban Smart contract interactions for secure asset transfers, atomic swaps, liquidity pools, sending and receiving .
6. **Analytics**: Integrated **Vercel Analytics** for tracking usage.

#### Tech Stack
1. **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (React, TypeScript, server-side rendering)
2. **Backend**: Supabase (serverless functions, database), Firebase (referral system)
3. **Authentication**: WebAuthn (passkeys), NextAuth.js (with Firebase adapter)
4. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Tremor components
5. **Blockchain**: Smart contracts for airdrops
6. **Deployment**: Vercel (serverless, preview mode, cache invalidation)
7. **Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, Vercel Analytics

### Getting Started

#### **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy `.env.development` to `.env.local`.
   - Copy `supabase/.env.development` to `supabase/.env.local`.
   - Add credentials for:
     - **Firebase** (for referral system and NextAuth.js adapter)
     - **Supabase** (for serverless functions and database)
     - **SendGrid** (for email-based magic links)
     - Blockchain-related keys (e.g., wallet or contract addresses, if applicable)

#### **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   supabase functions serve --env-file ./supabase/.env.local
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

#### **Edit and Develop**:
   - Modify `app/page.tsx` for frontend changes (auto-updates in development).
   - Customize smart contracts or backend logic as needed.
