# React + Vite

1. This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

The project is be setup to work in a monorepo structure, use pnpm is used as the package manager therefore you should install pnpm globally (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nathan_project.git
   ```
3. **Install Node modules**.

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Build Project Locally**.
