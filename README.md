## üö© Overview  





The merged project, **Zi Airdrop Playground**, is a decentralized application (dApp) built with **Next.js 14**, combining features for secure airdrop management with a referral system inspired by modern platforms like Slack, Notion, and Figma. It leverages blockchain technology, WebAuthn for authentication, and a magic link referral system. The project is developer-friendly, responsive, and optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

#### Key Features
1. **Airdrop Management**: Distribute digital assets to multiple recipients via blockchain smart contracts, through theme changes and classic games.
2. **Referral System**: Magic link-based referrals powered by **NextAuth.js** and **Firebase (Now Soroban Contact)**, inspired by collaborative platforms.
3. **WebAuthn Authentication**: Stellar's passkey protocol leverages the secp256r1 verification curve, Protocol 21, to enable passkey-powered smart wallets, no dapp to download, no passwords required.
4. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile using **Tailwind CSS** and **Tremor** components.
5. **Blockchain Integration**: Stellar Soroban Smart contract interactions for secure asset transfers, atomic swaps, liquidity pools, sending and receiving .
6. **Analytics**: Integrated **Vercel Analytics** for tracking usage.
7. **Classic Gamez **: Zig3 v3 Airdrop play ground interoduces classic games like **space invades**, and **tertis** where the user is paid to play.

#### Tech Stack
1. **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (React, TypeScript, server-side rendering)
2. **Backend**: Supabase (serverless functions, database), Stellar Soroban smart contracts (referral system)
3. **Authentication**: WebAuthn (passkeys), NextAuth.js (with Firebase adapter)
4. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Tremor components
5. **Blockchain**: Stellar Soroban Smart contracts for Sending, recieving, airdroping, swapping, liquidity pools, minting and staking. 
6. **Deployment**: Vercel (serverless, preview mode, cache invalidation)
7. **Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, Vercel Analytics
